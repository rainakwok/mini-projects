# Final Project
In this assignment, you will use this code to solve the Flatland minimum distance problem

### Problem
Help create a GIS system for a region called "Flatland" by implementing (and testing) the CityGraph Java class. Use it to solve the minimum turns and distance problem for the provided weighted graph.

### Data
N/A

### Setup command
N/A

### Run command
First, go to the FinalProject.java file and set the variable FILE1, to be 
the file you want to read in.

Then, you will need to use command line arguments to run the code. To do so, open up a terminal (in VS Code or in the root directory of the assignment) and use the following command structure:

`gradle run` will run the main function

### Test command
`gradle test` will run the unit tests on the implemented CityGraph class
